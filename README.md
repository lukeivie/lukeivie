**Hi there, I'm Luke!** I specialize in crafting simple, intuitive user experiences.

My preferred stack is TypeScript, React, and Prisma, and I'm a big fan of Next.js and TailwindCSS. I also dabble in Elixir, C#, and PHP.

Currently at [DiscountMags.com](https://discountmags.com). Previously UI Engineer at [Openforce](https://oforce.com). Before that â€“ UI Developer/UX Designer at [Tanga](https://www.tanga.com/).
