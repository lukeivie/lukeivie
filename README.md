Hi there, I'm Luke and I specialize in crafting simple, intuitive user experiences.

My preferred stack is TypeScript, React, and Prisma, and I'm a big fan of Next.js and TailwindCSS. I also dabble in Elixir, C#, and PHP.

Currently at DiscountMags.com. Previously UI Engineer at Openforce. Before that â€“ UI Developer/UX Designer at Tanga.
