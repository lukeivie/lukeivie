**Hi there, I'm Luke.** 

I am a full-stack software engineer who specializes in building web applications using JavaScript/Typescript and React. I am trained in agile and scrum methodologies and have worked for multiple SaaS companies. I also have UI/UX design experience, and I tend to work hybrid engineering/design roles.

I am highly passionate about technology and user experience. I believe every decision made in software should revolve around crafting the best possible experience for the end users.

Self-improvement is my primary focus in life. I seek to always be learning new things, evolving my craft, and becoming a better engineer, designer and human-being.

Currently Senior Frontend Software Engineer at [Namely](https://namely.com). Previously Full-Stack Engineer at [DiscountMags.com](https://discountmags.com). Before that â€“ UI Engineer at [Openforce](https://oforce.com). And even further before that â€“ UI Developer/UX Designer at [Tanga](https://www.tanga.com/).
