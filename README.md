# Luke Ivie

I specialize in crafting simple, intuitive user experiences.

I am a Full-Stack Engineer with a background in UI/UX Design. I strive to take what I've learned from product design over the years and apply those principles to code.

My preferred stack is TypeScript, React, and Prisma, and I'm a big fan of Next.js and TailwindCSS. I also dabble in Elixir, C#, and PHP.

Currently at DiscountMags.com. Previously UI Engineer at Openforce. Before that â€“ UI Developer/UX Designer at Tanga.

Self-improvement is my primary focus in life. I seek to always be learning new things, evolving my craft, and becoming a better engineer, designer and overall human-being.
